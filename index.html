They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assitance. TThe agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in way that no tutorial couuld ever have. In fact, I´ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certaninly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
